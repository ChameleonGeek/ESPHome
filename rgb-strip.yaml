# This is a very simple configuration that controls a "dumb" RGB LED strip, which has four connections:  12v, Red Ground, Green Ground and Blue Ground.
# For the ESP to control these strips, it needs three FETs since the ESP can't handle the voltage or current.
# The actual function of the light is called by the Home Assistant "server," not the ESP itself.
# I'm playing around with the PWM frequency to find the best range.  With 4000Hz, the LEDs appear to be fully off until set to 70% and then ramp from 
# what appears to be 0 percent to 100%
